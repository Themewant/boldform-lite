BoldForm Lite is the free tier of **BoldForm**, a freemium form builder. Build any kind of form visually, embed it anywhere, and manage every submission inside the WordPress dashboard — with zero bloat. **BoldForm Pro** (a separate plugin) extends Lite through hooks; Lite never depends on Pro.

## Features

- **Drag & drop builder** — compose forms visually, reorder fields, configure each instantly.
- **Many field types** — text, email, number, phone, URL, select/multi‑select, checkbox, radio, country, date & time, star rating, slider/range, input mask, file upload, structured Name & Address, section breaks, paragraphs, HTML, and terms.

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| WordPress | 6.3 |
| PHP | 7.4 |
| Tested up to | WordPress 7.0 |

For development (building the ZIP) you additionally need **Node.js 20+** and **npm** — see below.

---

## Installation (for site owners)

1. Download the latest `boldform-lite-<version>.zip` (from a release, or build it yourself — see [Development](#development)).
2. In WordPress, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, choose the ZIP, and install.
3. Activate the plugin from the **Plugins** screen.
4. Open **BoldForm** in the admin sidebar and create your first form.

> Installing from this repository directly (e.g. `git clone` into `wp-content/plugins/`) also works for development, but the production ZIP is the recommended way to ship.

---

## Embedding a form

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| **Shortcode** | `[boldform id="123"]` |
| **Gutenberg block** | Insert the **BoldForm** block in any page or post |
| **Elementor widget** | Drag the **BoldForm** widget into any Elementor layout |

---

## Development

The repository is the plugin itself. The only build step is packaging a clean,
distributable ZIP — there is **no compile/transpile step**; PHP, CSS, and JS are
hand‑maintained and run as‑is.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm** (the build uses [`@wordpress/scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts)).
- A **PHP 7.4+** environment to run the plugin (any local WordPress stack — Local, wp-env, MAMP, Docker, etc.).
- `zip` / `unzip` available on your `PATH` (standard on macOS and Linux).

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone into your WordPress plugins directory (recommended for live testing)
git clone https://github.com/Themewant/boldform-lite.git
cd boldform-lite

# 2. Install dev dependencies
npm install
```

`npm install` pulls in `@wordpress/scripts` (used only for packaging) into `node_modules/`. Nothing in `node_modules/` ships with the plugin.

### Building a distributable ZIP

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces the installable plugin archive at:

```
build/boldform-lite-<version>.zip
```

The build uses `wp-scripts plugin-zip` to bundle only the files listed in `package.json`'s `files` array, then strips development‑only files (`package.json`, `README.md`) from the archive. The result is a clean ZIP ready to upload to any WordPress site or submit to WordPress.org.

> The version in the ZIP name comes from `package.json`. Keep it in sync with the
> `Stable tag` in [`readme.txt`](readme.txt) and the `BOLDFORM_LITE_VERSION` constant in
> [`boldform-lite.php`](boldform-lite.php) when releasing.

To package only when the working tree is clean (a release safeguard):

```bash
npm run release
```

### npm scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Install dev dependencies (`@wordpress/scripts`). Run once after cloning. |
| `npm run build` | Package `build/boldform-lite-<version>.zip` (dev‑only files stripped). |
| `npm run release` | Verify the git working tree is clean, then run `build`. |

**Data model:** two custom tables — `{prefix}boldform_forms` and `{prefix}boldform_entries` (no custom post type). A form's layout is stored as JSON in the shape `rows → columns → fields`: the builder writes it, the renderer reads it back.

---

## Architecture in brief

- **Bootstrap:** [`boldform-lite.php`](boldform-lite.php) defines constants and boots the plugin; [`includes/class-boldform-lite.php`](includes/class-boldform-lite.php) is the service container and the map of every service and hook — the best place to start reading.
- **Save flow:** the builder (`assets/js/builder.js`) posts to `admin/ajax-save.php`, which allowlists field types and sanitizes every value by type before storing the layout JSON.
- **Render flow:** `public/class-boldform-lite-shortcode.php` renders a form; the block and Elementor widget both reuse it so output stays identical across embeds.
- **Submit flow:** `public/class-boldform-lite-form-handler.php` validates and stores an entry (forms accept submissions only when published), fires notification/integration hooks, then returns the AJAX result.
- **Settings:** a single option array, `boldform_lite_settings`; the schema version gate is `boldform_lite_db_version`.

## Extending BoldForm

BoldForm Lite exposes a stable set of actions and filters so add‑ons (and BoldForm Pro) can extend it without modifying core. Common seams:

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `boldform_allowed_field_types` (filter) | Register a new field type |
| `boldform_validate_field` (filter) | Add server‑side validation for a field |
| `boldform_field_library` (filter) | Add a field to the builder palette |
| `boldform_entry_created` (action) | React after an entry is saved |
| `boldform_gate_submission` (filter) | Reject a submission early (spam, etc.) |
| `boldform_integration_dispatched` (action) | Observe an integration call's result |
| `boldform_loaded` (action) | Bootstrap an add‑on once Lite is ready |

Shipped hooks are treated as a stable API — arguments are not renamed or reordered; behaviour is deprecated rather than broken.

## Contributing

- Branch from and open pull requests against **`development`**. `main` is release‑only.
- Follow the **WordPress Coding Standards** (tabs, Yoda conditions, braces); baseline **PHP 7.4**.
- **Sanitize on input, escape on output.** Use a nonce + `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )` on every privileged/AJAX action.
- No remote code or CDNs; document any external service in `readme.txt`.
- Run `php -l` on changed PHP files and wrap new strings in the `boldform-lite` text domain before opening a PR.
