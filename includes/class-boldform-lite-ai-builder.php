/**
 * AI Form Builder.
 *
 * Generates a complete form structure from a plain-language description. The
 * admin types "a job application form with a CV upload"; the module turns that
 * into real BoldForm fields on the builder canvas.
 *
 * ── How it works ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. A "Create with AI" card is injected beside the Blank Form / Use a
 *      Template cards on the builder's starting screens (pure JS — see
 *      assets/js/ai-builder.js).
 *   2. The prompt is POSTed to this module's REST route, which is nonce- and
 *      capability-gated.
 *   3. PHP calls the language model **server-side** and constrains the reply
 *      with a JSON schema whose `type` enum is built from the site's REAL field
 *      registry (`boldform_allowed_field_types`). The model therefore cannot
 *      invent a field type this install does not have.
 *   4. The validated spec is returned to the builder, which maps it to Lite's
 *      rows -> columns -> fields structure and hands it to Lite's own
 *      normalizeStructure()/renderAll() — the same path a template takes.
 *
 * ── One transport ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The site calls the chosen provider directly (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini or
 * OpenRouter; see `providers()`) with a key the admin supplied. There is no
 * BoldForm infrastructure in the path and nothing is proxied — a prompt goes
 * from this site to that provider and nowhere else, which is also what the
 * readme's External Services section promises.
 *
 * ── Why the call is made from PHP, not the browser ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Calling the provider straight from admin JS would put the endpoint (and, on
 * the BYO path, the API key) in front of anyone who opens devtools, and would
 * leave the hosted endpoint open to the world. Routing through a REST route
 * keeps the credential server-side, lets the nonce + `manage_options` check do
 * real work, and gives one place to rate-limit.
